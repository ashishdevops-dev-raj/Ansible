### Example: Install Nginx on a server

1. Create a file called `nginx-playbook.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Nginx Web Server
  hosts: localhost
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Ensure Nginx is running
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: true
```

2. Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook nginx-playbook.yml
```

This will install and start **Nginx** on your localhost.
